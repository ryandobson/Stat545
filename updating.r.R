##Updating R, Rstudio, and R packages


update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)
#This only searches for packages on CRAN so you need to 
#do something different if the package is on Github 


#Checking if you have the most up to date version of R 
R.version.string

#Update your packages 
#update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)

#Try to never fall more than 1 minor version behind of RStudio
#Keep your RStudio up to date! 

#Expect to update RStudio more often than R
